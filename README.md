## Overview

An introduction to graphics, This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines using a graphics library.

## Description

-   This project is implemented in c and is compilable with a Makefile.
-   Memory leaks free, Memory leaks are not to be tolerated.
-   Error free, an error displayed in case something went wrong.
-   The program uses the 42 `minilibx` as a graphics library.
-   The management of the window remains smooth through the program lifespan.
-   Pressing ESC closes the window and quits the program in a clean way.
-   Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame also closes the window and quit the program in a clean way.
-   The program takes a map and transforms it into a 3d landscape and displays a landscape in a window using an **isometric projection**.
-   The coordinates of the landscape can be stored in a `.fdf` file passed as a parameter to the program.
-   As a bonus The program Includes the following extra features:
-   an extra projection **Orthographic**.
-   The ability to Zoom in and out, Translate and Rotate the model.
-   The program is able to transform a map like this :
